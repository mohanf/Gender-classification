Plan for gabor method:

=> resize to 20 x 20 pixel image (do not need detailed info)
=> apply gabor and get response image(magnitude)
=> normalize to mean 0 + unit variance
=>
	a. PCA
	b. variance and mean (not recommended)
	c. variance of each column and mean of whole image

* Possibly do it on frequency domain using FFT
* Possibly use downsampling
* Possibly valid convolution
* Possibly remove the first eigenvector
* PCA + LDA: W = W1 * W2
